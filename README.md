# SmartHotel360
During our **Connect(); 2017** event this year we presented beautiful app demos using Xamarin.

We are happy to announce the release of SmartHotel360. This release intends to share a simplified version of SmartHotel360 reference sample apps used at Connect(); 2017 Keynotes. If you missed it, you can watch <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Connect/2017/K100">Scott Guthrieâ€™s Keynote: Journey to the Intelligent Cloud in Channel 9</a>.

# SmartHotel360 - Backend Services

Welcome to the SmartHotel360 Backend repository. Here you'll find everything you need to run the backend services locally and/or deploy them in a Azure environment.

## Getting Started

SmartHotel360 uses a **microservice oriented** architecture implemented using Docker containers. There are various services developed in different technologies: .NET Core 2, Java, and Node.js. These services use different data stores like PostgreSQL and SQL Server.

In production all these microservices run in a Kubernetes cluster, powered by Azure Container Service (ACS or AKS).

## Prerequisites

All of the back-end systems run inside of Docker containers. To build locally and see how things work the only requirement is that you install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). 

During the installation phase you will notice errors if you haven't set your Docker configuration to use 4 GB of memory. Changing this is simple within the Docker configuration dialog. Just set the memory higher and restart Docker.

## Building locally

Clone this repository using your favorite Git client or by using the command: 

`git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/SmartHotel360-Azure-backend.git`

Go to `/src` folder and type:

```
docker-compose build
```

After some minutes you'll have all Docker images created on your computer. Following images will be created (type `docker images` to see all images you have in your system):

* `smarthotels/suggestions`
* `smarthotels/notifications`
* `smarthotels/reviews`
* `smarthotels/hotels`
* `smarthotels/tasks`
* `smarthotels/discounts`
* `smarthotels/profiles`
* `smarthotels/configuration`

## Running microservices locally

All microservices can be run locally using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Starting all of the microservice images is a simple 3-step process. 

### 1. Start the data stores

PostgreSQL and SQL Server databases are stored in Docker containers. These containers should be started first so the databases are on-line when the application logic containers start up. Start the data stores first by typing: 

```
docker-compose up sql-data reviews-data tasks-data
``` 

Wait for those containers to be initialized; you'll know they're ready once the console output stops appearing for longer than a minute. The screen shot below demonstrates the data store containiners' setup being complete and with them in a ready state.

### 2. Start the microservices

Once the data stores are running, the microservices can be started. Open a new terminal window and execute a second call to docker-compose, this time with no images specified. 

> Note: It is important that you open a **new** terminal window and leave the first one running. Killing the terminal process with a `Ctrl-C` will stop all of the data containers.

```
docker-compose up
``` 
This will start all the remaining containers. Once the containers are online the terminal should stop updating for a few seconds. The terminal screen shot below demonstrates what the terminal should look like once all the microservice containers are running. 

![Microservices up](docs/microservices-up.png)

### 3. Verify services are running

Once the containers are started using the `docker-compose up` commands, their running state can be verified by executing this command:

```
docker ps
```

The terminal window will show all of the containers running. Take note of the ports that have been set for each of the microservice containers. 

![Container ports](docs/containers-and-ports.png)

Each of these ports redirects to port `80` within the container image. Most of these microservices expose an [Open API Specification](https://www.openapis.org/) (formerly known as Swagger) endpoint that describes the back-end REST APIs. To verify the APIs are up and running, use any of the ports in this list to browse the API description page for each of the microservices. 

> Note: not all of these URLs will result with a Swagger-UI test page, but they all should resolve once the microservices are all running.
